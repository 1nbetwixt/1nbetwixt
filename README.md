Thank you for visiting my profile!

Here I will post all my previously completed projects, projects I am working on, and anything else that fits!

Some things about me:
  - :musical_note: I am a musician at heart!
  - :video_game: I love to game every now and then!
  - :book: I am an avid reader, and love to learn!
  - :dragon: I am a Dungeon Master for the 5th edition of D&D!

I am currently learning as many stacks as possible so that I may live a life as an ambitious and creative coder!

If you have any questions, or would like to work together, please reach out to me!
